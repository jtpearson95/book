# book project

In this project, we worked with react and bootstrap to build components that would create cards to display information about a group of books from a json file of data. I added code that displays the cards of data alphabetically, and also changed the navbar so that it responds to this sorting and will take you to alphabetized sections of cards based on the author's last names. This was achieved with scroll to view. 

In order to build this application, you will need to download all files. 

I would like to continue building on the aesthetics and functionality of this exercise.
